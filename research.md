### Working Paper

* [_Analyzing Dynamic Multiple Spell Durations using Counting Processes,_](https://yuhaoli-academic.github.io/JMP1.pdf) (Job Market Paper 1)
> <font size="2.0">I propose a counting process approach to analyze multiple spell duration data. These data are doubly stochastic in a sense that both durations for an individual and the number of durations within a fixed period are random. I allow unobserved individual heterogeneities to enter into the model as fixed effects. In addition, conditional on the individual fixed effect, durations are state dependent. A first-difference transformation is developed to cancel fixed effects, and a minimum distance estimator is re-introduced with simplified proofs. Finite sample properties are investigated in simulations. The approach is applied to studying an individual’s work absence decisions. </font>

* [_Consistent Test for Conditional Moment Restriction Models in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces_ (with Xiaojun Song), ](https://yuhaoli-academic.github.io/JMP2.pdf) (Job Market Paper 2) 
> <font size="2.0">In this paper, we represent Integrated Conditional Moment (ICM) tests in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). There are several advantages of doing so. First, reproduc-ing kernels embody dimension and integral measure, and hence, are effective dimension reduction tools. This phenomenon can be explained by the isometrically isomorphic relationship among infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Second, the test statistics, expressed in terms of kernels, have analytic closed forms, making them easy to compute in practice. Third, one can generate kernels easily and massively from existing kernels. Each kernel corresponds to an ICM test, thus, for certain models, one may obtain a more sensitive test than by using conventional ones. We further propose projection-based kernels to eliminate
estimation effect, leading to a simple multiplier bootstrap procedure to obtain critical values. A minimum distance estimator is developed as a byproduct. Monte Carlo exercises are performed to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed test, and an empirical application is studied. </font>


* [_Modelling Dynamic Moral Hazard in Individual Outpatient Claims (with Rui Cui),_](https://yuhaoli-academic.github.io/Health_Hawkes.pdf)
><font size="2.0"> Typical health insurance contracts have cost-sharing policies (deductibles, coinsurance rates and caps on out-of-pocket expenditure). These policy designs create dynamic incentives for moral hazard: with each consumption, the gap between the deductible (and the out-of-pocket cap) decreases, and the health care price is effectively cheaper. This paper aims to model the dynamic moral hazard using a Hawkes process framework. A Hawkes process is a counting process with self-exciting and branching features. We build a stylized model to define the dynamic moral hazard in terms of the intensity of a Hawkes process. Based on it, we parameterize the intensity and estimate the reduced form model by a minimum distance estimation method. The dynamic moral hazard in this approach is state-dependent but can be summarized by a single quantity called the branching ratio. We present distributions of the branching ratio for different insurance coverages.      </font>

* [_Goodness-of-Fit Tests for General Counting Processes_ (with Xiaojun Song and Rui Cui).](https://yuhaoli-academic.github.io/Counting_Proc_test.pdf)
><font size="2.0"> We propose an omnibus goodness-of-fit test for general counting processes. We show our test is consistent against (almost) any deviation, and can detect local alternatives tending to the null at a √n rate. We contribute to the literature in the following aspects. First,
the test statistic is constructed based on an empirical process rather than a sequence of transformed event times. Second, we explicitly take the estimation effect into consideration when bootstrapping the critical value. Third, the proposed framework is valid for both the one-observational counting process as well as the n-observational process. Monte Carlo experiments results suggest good size and power properties of our test, and a simple empirical application is also studied. </font>
