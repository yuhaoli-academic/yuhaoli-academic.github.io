### Working in process

* Modeling Marked Self-Exciting Process, 2016
  * In this paper,we propose a new method to model the self-exciting process with
    marks when more than one observations exist.We show that our method is flexible
    in both continuous and discrete mark space, and can be applied to handle the
    case where dependent censoring is presented. We demonstrate the new estimation
    method via a simulation of ETAS model, and applied it to study the cost-sharing
    effect in health insurance using the RAND health insurance experiment data.
