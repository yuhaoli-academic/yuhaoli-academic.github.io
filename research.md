* Strategic Behaviour in Work Absence: A Dynamic View
  * <font size ="3.0">We use the self-exciting processes to study individuals' absence behaviours. Such behaviours are dynamic and strategical because of the firm's absence regulation, where a worker's absence records determine her absence benefit. The self-exciting process has a compensator that is conditioned on a self-generated filtration and hence is state-dependent. It enables researchers to include individual history information into the model. We decompose an absence into an incidence event ('asking for absence') and a recovery event ('returning to work'). For each absence, we also distinguish short-term from long-term. Using firm-level data, we find that workers do consider absence records when they have short-term incidence and recovery events, but this is not the case for long-term events. Inspired by the empirical results, we build a simple economic model.  </font> 

### Working paper

* The Cost-Sharing, Shadow Price and Cluster in Medical Care Utilization: A Self-Exciting Perspective, 2017
  * <font size="3.0">In this paper, a self-exciting counting process modelling method is proposed to study the frequency of the medical care service utilization when cost-sharing tools like out-of-pocket cap is included in the health insurance policy. This modelling strategy enables researchers to investigate individual's dynamic behaviour in a more detailed way. Specifically, for each individual, every doctor visiting record is represented as a point in a self-exciting counting process. Cost associated with each visiting is included in this counting process as a mark. History information that included in this self-exciting counting process permits us not only to study the dynamic structure of the process, to characterise the shadow price that is generated by the cost-sharing tools, but also to measure the true state dependency (one way to characterize the unobserved heterogeneity). The parametric cumulative intensity which equals the mean of the underling counting process is our estimating object. A minimum distance method is employed to find the estimators. Using the Rand Health Insurance Experiment data, we find that individuals respond to the change of shadow price. Moreover, we use a mature cluster analysis algorithm and find out that compare to the free plan, cost-sharing insurance plan with deductibles suppress the use of medical service by limiting the number of clusters as well as the follow-up visiting within each cluster.</font>
