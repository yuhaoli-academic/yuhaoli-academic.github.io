### Working Paper

* [The Dynamic Behavior in Work Absence](https://yuhaoli-academic.github.io/jmp.pdf)
  * <font size ="3.0">We use the self-exciting processes to study individuals' absence behaviors. Such behaviors are dynamic because of the firm's absence regulation, where a worker's absence records determine her absence benefit. The self-exciting process is state-dependent and enables us to include the individual's absence records into the model. We decompose an absence into an incidence event (`asking for absence') and a recovery event (`returning to work'). For each absence, we also distinguish short-term from long-term. Using firm-level data, we find that workers do consider absence records when they make short-term incidence and recovery decisions, but this is not the case for long-term events. Inspired by the empirical results, we build a simple economic model.   </font> 


* [Assessing Individual's Response to the Nonlinear Health Insurance Plan: Evidence From A Hawkes Process](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986884), 2021
  * <font size="3.0">This paper studies an individual's responsiveness to the outpatient utilization under a nonlinear health insurance contract. Specifically, we aim to investigate how a change of the shadow price of medical services would affect an individual's doctor-visit probability given all the history information. We define the episode-varying shadow price as the conditional expectation of the end-of-year co-insurance rate given the cumulative individual spending at current time. Conditional on a stochastic cumulative individual spending process creates econometric challenges as the data generating process is a doubly stochastic process. We represent occurrence times of each doctor visit as points in a Hawkes process. The structure of the Hawkes process enables us to account for various history-dependent effects, including the shadow price effect. In addition, the Hawkes process framework also provides a way to analyze the cluster pattern of an individual's doctor visits. Studying the RAND Health Insurance Experiment data, we found that individuals do understand the price incentive of a nonlinear contract. We also found that setting a free insurance plan as a control, a same canonical individual who is in a cost-sharing insurance plan would have fewer doctor visit clusters, and the average number of doctor visits within each cluster also shrinks. </font>
