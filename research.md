* Strategic Behaviour in Work Absence: A Dynamic View
  * <font size ="2.9">Most of the literatures studying the work absenteeism focus on the sick related absences, where events are assumed to be i.i.d. Such assumption, however, is incompatible with work discipline regulations used in most firms, where one's work absence benefit is determined by its own absence history. In this paper, we use the self-exciting process to model and analysis the strategic behaviour of not only the sick absence but any work absence. The fact that the self-exciting process is state dependent enables us to introduce one's history into the model. We construct models for both incidence ('asking for absence') decisions and recovery ('returning to work') decisions. Using a firm level absence data, we find strong evidence that workers do take their history into consideration in the incidence decisions (strategic behaviour), and in the recovery decisions, only short-term recovery exhibits such strategic behaviours while in the long-term absences, workers do not concern their absence history. </font> 

### Working paper

* A Marked Self-Exciting Model of Medical Care Use, 2017
  * <font size="2.9">In this paper, a self-exciting counting process modelling method is proposed to study the frequency of the medical care service utilization when cost-sharing tools like out-of-pocket cap is included in the health insurance policy. This modelling strategy enables researchers to investigate individual's dynamic behaviour in a more detailed way. Specifically, for each individual, every doctor visiting record is represented as a point in a self-exciting counting process. Cost associated with each visiting is included in this counting process as a mark. History information that included in this self-exciting counting process permits us not only to study the dynamic structure of the process, to characterise the shadow price that is generated by the cost-sharing tools, but also to measure the true state dependency (one way to characterize the unobserved heterogeneity). The parametric cumulative intensity which equals the mean of the underling counting process is our estimating object. A minimum distance method is employed to find the estimators. Using the Rand Health Insurance Experiment data, we find that individuals respond to the change of shadow price. Moreover, we use a mature cluster analysis algorithm and find out that compare to the free plan, cost-sharing insurance plan with deductibles suppress the use of medical service by limiting the number of clusters as well as the follow-up visiting within each cluster.</font>
