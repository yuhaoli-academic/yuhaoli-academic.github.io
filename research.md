### Working Paper

* [The Dynamic Behavior in Work Absence](https://yuhaoli-academic.github.io/jmp.pdf)
  * <font size ="3.0">We use the self-exciting processes to study individuals' absence behaviors. Such behaviors are dynamic because of the firm's absence regulation, where a worker's absence records determine her absence benefit. The self-exciting process is state-dependent and enables us to include the individual's absence records into the model. We decompose an absence into an incidence event (`asking for absence') and a recovery event (`returning to work'). For each absence, we also distinguish short-term from long-term. Using firm-level data, we find that workers do consider absence records when they make short-term incidence and recovery decisions, but this is not the case for long-term events. Inspired by the empirical results, we build a simple economic model.   </font> 


* [Assessing Individual's Response to the Nonlinear Health Insurance Plan: Evidence From A Hawkes Process](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3986884), 2021
  * <font size="3.0">In this paper, a Hawkes process is proposed to study an individual's responsiveness to the outpatient utilization under a nonlinear health insurance contract. For a given individual, each doctor visit record is represented as a point in a Hawkes process. When measuring the responsiveness, we adopt the episode-varying shadow price instead of a constant spot price or the expected end-of-year price. Using the RAND Health Insurance Experiment data, we found that individuals do understand the price incentive of a nonlinear contract. Our model can also describe the cluster patterns of outpatient utilization under different insurance plans. Comparing to a free insurance plan, a canonical individual in the cost sharing insurance plan would have fewer doctor visits in a cluster, and the cluster number also shrinks. </font>
