* Strategic Behaviour in Work Absence: A Dynamic View
  * <font size ="3.0">We use the self-exciting processes to study individuals' absence behaviours. Such behaviours are dynamic and strategic because of the firm's absence regulation, where a worker's absence records determine her absence benefit. The self-exciting process has a compensator that is conditioned on a self-generated filtration and hence is state-dependent. It enables us to include the individual's absence records into the model. We decompose an absence into an incidence event ('asking for absence') and a recovery event ('returning to work'). For each absence, we also distinguish short-term from long-term. Using firm-level data, we find that workers do consider absence records when they have short-term incidence and recovery events, but this is not the case for long-term events. Inspired by the empirical results, we build a simple economic model.  </font> 

### Working paper

* The Cost-Sharing, Shadow Price and Cluster in Medical Care Utilization: A Self-Exciting Perspective, 2017
  * <font size="3.0">In this paper, a self-exciting counting process modelling method is proposed to study the frequency of medical care service utilization under a non-linear budget constraint health insurance policy. This modelling strategy enables researchers to investigate individual's dynamic behavior in a more detailed way. Specifically, for each individual, every doctor visiting record is represented as a point in a self-exciting counting process. Cost associated with such visiting is included in this counting process as a mark. A minimum distance method is employed to find the estimators. Using the Rand Health Insurance Experiment data, we find that individuals respond to a change of shadow price. In addition, we use a matured cluster analysis algorithm to investigate the cluster patterns and discover that compared to free plan, cost-sharing insurance plan with out-of-pocket fees suppress the use of medical services by limiting the number of clusters as well as follow-up visiting within each cluster.</font>
