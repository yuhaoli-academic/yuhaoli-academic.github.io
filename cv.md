## Working in Process

* A Marked Self-Exciting Model of Medical Care Use
	* In this paper, we propose a marked self-exciting process to fit the Rand health insurance experiment claim-based (episode-based) data. Such modelling method aims to address the individual dynamic behavior and sudden jumps in the process. Each event (visiting to a health care service provider) is represented as a point stored in a counting process that records the behavior of one individual. Marks (costs) associated with the occurrence of events is included in the model and a generic probabilistic structure of the marked intensity is presented in this paper. A minimal distance method first developed by Kopperschmidt and Stute (2013) is used to find the estimators. The model uses patientâ€™s personal insurance claim records to characterize individual heterogeneity. We find that individuals are insensitive to the change of the cost of medical care which is consistent with the finding of Keeler and Rolph(1988).
